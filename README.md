# mxskinnamer
This is a python script that appropriately names provided skin textures for the desired bike dynos. Naming skins for MX Simulator is confusing and tedious so this script was made to make the process easier. This script works with multiple diffuse maps at once and with or without a normal and/or specular map.

## How to Use

**You will need Python installed on your machine to use this*
### Prep
You will need *at least* one diffuse map (You can use as many diffuse maps as you want). This is the map that your graphics are on. This map can be named whatever you want it to be but it cannot have 'N[n]orm' or 'S[s]pec' in it. Optionally you can also use normal and specular maps. These need to have 'N[n]orm' and 'S[s]pec' in the name, respectively.
### Install Python
1. Go to (https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest release of Python
2. Follow the installer instructions for your operating system

### Running the Script

#### Double-Click
1. Extract the script somewhere on your computer
2. Double-click the scrip
#### Terminal/Command Line
1. Extract the script somewhere to your computer
2. Open a terminal or command line

### Usage
1. Click the browse button and navigate to the directory that contains your skins (diffuse textures, normal map, and specular map)
2. Type the model name you're saving for in the 'Model Name' text box. This is what your JM name is after the dyno
3. Select the dyno that you're saving for in the 'Bike Dyno' list
